Runner for Cube World Server.

Allows you to set a seed when you run the server. No need to edit your server.cfg manually ðŸ˜‰.

## ðŸ”§ How it works:

Download zip file [here](https://github.com/Matriz88/CubeWorldServerRunner/releases/latest)

Extract `CubeWorldServerRunner.exe` in your Cube World installation folder. (Default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Cube World`).

Run `CubeWorldServerRunner.exe`.

You'll be asked for a server seed. If you don't want to change the current seed, specified in brackets, leave it blank and just press `enter`.

If you insert a new seed, it will be saved in your server configuration.

Then server starts.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

### Setup server

If you're new about Cube World server remember to run Cube World at least once, otherwise you won't have `Server.exe` in your installation folder. It will be generated after the first start of the game.

### Server port

The server runs on port `12345` and this cannot be changed. Be sure to add this port in your port forward settings on your modem/router.
